			of punching beasts" said Blitz. "I've heard if beasts eat Herba Mystica they become titans"
			."I wonder what would happen if humans ate it" said Scarlet, looking at his book.
			"Have you heard that in Glacido Mountain you can see the legenedary Baxcalibur, or if you venture
			into the Dark Crater you might see Great Tusk or Samalance?". "Why are you called Scarlet again
			anyway?" asked Blitz. "Because of this, the Blazing Egg" replied Scarlet.

			didn't look very friendly. The biggest one did a backwards kick on them. "Horse Kick" said Scarlet.
			"Not cool". The lead Arctobax started to glow with a golden light. "What is happening?!" said
			Blitz and Scarlet.
