                Henry James is happy to have found another Know-Your-Monster. It has
                been a long wait since he last found one. This monster was discovered
                in Wales. He wonders if the monsters have just stopped living in England ?!
                When he returned to England he found that monsters were just lying on the ground
                with holes in their head like someone had been sucking on their brains. Henry will
                investigate further in his next letter.

                    My next letter starts at a BBQ with Jonathan. Me, Adam, Jonathan, and Julia
                    were having a BBQ with pizza. Just then a the pizza machine caught on fire.
                    Just then a bird made of fire flew out of a portal which was on the fire. The
                    bird pulled me inside the portal. The portal was inside the flames, and as it
                    pulled me through I felt something punch me in the face. It was a bully monster!!
                    "HA HA" said the bully monster, "Outsider, want to challenge me to a fight?"
                    "Yes" I said. "Mu ha ha ha ha " screamed the bully, "This little outsider thinks he
                    can beat me in a fight? Seriously?!"
                </p>
                <p class="my-2">
                    I picked up a bunch of mud and threw it into the bully's face. "Ahhh, I can't see" screamed
                    the bully. I picked up a bird of fire on brought it down on the bully. "Fwmmmm" went the bully
                    as I picked it up and put it in my MonsterWorks suitcase. But just as I was doing my heroic pose,
                    I was grabbed on the ankle by a Pudgy Pig. He waas wearing a silver helmet with a feather on the
                    top. " Snort-HAHA" he said. "You'll be good in the Monster Wars" he laughed, and shoved me into
                    a sack.
