                Henry James is happy to have found another Know-Your-Monster. It has
                been a long wait since he last found one. This monster was discovered
                in Wales. He wonders if the monsters have just stopped living in England ?!
                When he returned to England he found that monsters were just lying on the ground
                with holes in their head like someone had been sucking on their brains. Henry will
                investigate further in his next letter.

                    My next letter starts at a BBQ with Jonathan. Me, Adam, Jonathan, and Julia
                    were having a BBQ with pizza. Just then a the pizza machine caught on fire.
                    Just then a bird made of fire flew out of a portal which was on the fire. The
                    bird pulled me inside the portal. The portal was inside the flames, and as it
                    pulled me through I felt something punch me in the face. It was a bully monster!!
                    "HA HA" said the bully monster, "Outsider, want to challenge me to a fight?"
                    "Yes" I said. "Mu ha ha ha ha " screamed the bully, "This little outsider thinks he
                    can beat me in a fight? Seriously?!"
                </p>
                <p class="my-2">
                    I picked up a bunch of mud and threw it into the bully's face. "Ahhh, I can't see" screamed
                    the bully. I picked up a bird of fire on brought it down on the bully. "Fwmmmm" went the bully
                    as I picked it up and put it in my MonsterWorks suitcase. But just as I was doing my heroic pose,
                    I was grabbed on the ankle by a Pudgy Pig. He waas wearing a silver helmet with a feather on the
                    top. " Snort-HAHA" he said. "You'll be good in the Monster Wars" he laughed, and shoved me into
                    a sack.

                I fell out of the pigs bag with a "fwwwnch!!" I grabbed my notebook just as I fell out to find right in
                front of me was a hydra worm, and several hogs. "FIIIGHT" screamed the biggest hog. He had a skull on his head,
                sharp black claws, big bulgin' red fists, pony tails (not exactly in keeping with the look of fear) and
                teeth strapped onto his arms. The hydra worms plunged towards me, as I leapt out, I was frightened,
                but soon I knew just what to do. When the hydra worm's head went left I went right, and when it went right I went left.
                Soon it was so dizzy that it puked so much that it fell over. Destroyed. Just then some of the pigs came forwards,
                they went "snort, snort snort" in the most piggy way. The biggest pig dropped down from its seat
                and said "I am the best of level one. What do you want?". "Why are you called that?" I asked, as I reached
                for my notebook. "Well, I'm the biggest of the children" replied the hog. "But why level one?" I asked.
                "Well I guess there are the guards". Two giant green hulking guards came marching forwards. "Oh and I suppose
                there's the king". Then a giant hog with a mask on rode out, riding on top of an enormous bull.

                    he laughed. "So we-dfl me-ldkjf-et finally". "I have been looking for you" the king said again.
                    "Now it is time you learned who I actually am" as he grabbed his helment, and begain pulling
                    and pulling at it, until it flew off, revealing a head covered in green splodges. "So bully is not the
                    brainsucker" I muttered to myself, as I wrote in this very letter. "You are" I said out loud. Green
                    antennae splodged off the brainsuckers face and one eye opened. "hmm mmm mmm" he said smirking
                    and twisting his head around like a football. "I have good news, all your monsters are gone". I gasped.
                    "No more monsters means no more viewers". "I think you are a bit wrong" I whispered as I opened my notebook.
                    His face fumed and he puched his fist towards my iPa-

                    Good news. I found a computer after he ripped my ipad. Indeed all of the monsters are gone. Every
                    single one. And he is about to challenge me against one of the biggest baddest monsters in England.
                    Nightsucker. He put a chain around Nightsuckers neck and thrust him towards me.  Nightsucker said
                    "My time, has come" in a raspy voice.

                    After I defeated Nightskull in the killer battle then the brainsucker was so angry it sent
                    an asteroid to my house. At this point in time then it was the last day of the summer holidays
                    and we rocking with a party, with balloons, and even a giant know your monsters fountain.
                    Just then we saw that the asteroid was very very close and speeding fast towards us. It started to
                    slam in just as I was trying to finish this sentence but before I am dead I might just be able to-
